# og-insilico-mlst
A very old set of scripts I wrote in Perl to generate mlst profiles before galaxy, Mentalist and SRST2 were a thing.

I do not expect anyone to use this as there are much better tools available, but its fun to look back at what you were doing 
over 5 years ago compared to today.

I was particularly proud of these scripts as it was my first attempt to make a 'tool' with some commenting so that others could use them.
